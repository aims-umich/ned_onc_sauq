## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Create a new conda environment with name (`onc`)
conda env create -n onc python=3.12

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate onc

# 3. Install all needed libraries
pip install tensorflow==2.19.0
pip install scikit-learn==1.7.0
pip install SALib==1.5.1
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy seaborn

# 4. Install Jupyter and Papermill for notebook execution if needed
pip install jupyter papermill

```

## How to generate the results

- You can regenerate most of the results in the paper by running the Python script `onc.py` or the notebook `onc.ipynb`, which will generate a directory named `mbe_results` that include the figures and tables. Note the following:
  - All data files are saved under the data directory `/data/`
  - The file `best_nn_model.keras` shows a pretrained neural network model that was generated via the mode `train` in the script. If you want to generate another model, make sure to switch the mode to the training mode, otherwise, the script will load this pre-trained model, which will accelerate the processing.
  - Sample results that are expected to generated by the script are provided under the folder `paper_results`.
    


## Notes 
  - Please note that because machine learning training involves inherent randomness (e.g., random initialization and seeding), your numerical results may differ slightly from those reported in the paper. These variations are expected to be minimal and do not affect the validity of the conclusions, even if the script is executed multiple times with different random seeds.
